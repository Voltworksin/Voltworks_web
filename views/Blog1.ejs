                        <p>Axial flux motors (AFMs) often known as the pancake motors; is a configuration of electric motor where the direction of magnetic flux between the rotor and stator is aligned parallel to the axis of rotation. They are particularly important for electric vehicle (EV) and electric airplane applications, where high power density and efficiency are crucial. In this blog, we'll explore how AFMs work, their benefits, and how soft magnetic composites (SMCs) can unlock their hidden assets.</p>

                        <p>Axial flux motors are a type of electric motor that has a unique design, with the rotor and stator arranged in a disc-like shape, as opposed to the cylindrical shape of conventional motors. The rotor and stator are placed on either side of the air gap, which allows for a more compact design and a higher power density. AFMs are also more efficient than conventional motors due to their shorter magnetic path length and reduced core loss.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Benefits of Axial Flux Motors</h2>
                        <!-- <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p> -->
                        <p>One of the main benefits of axial flux motors is their high-power density. Because of their compact design, they can pack more power into a smaller space, making them ideal for EV and electric airplane applications. They also offer high torque and efficiency, making them more efficient than other motor types.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">SMCs and AFMs</h2>
                        <p>SMCs a.k.a. soft magnetic composites material made of a mixture of iron powder and an insulating binder, which allows them to be easily formed into complex shapes using conventional moulding process. These particles when moulded and sintered with right material and processes can offer a completely new domain of possibilities of optimization in the performance of motor. The motor running on soft magnetic composites can be made to run faster, more compact, and denser, high permeability, lower core/ eddy current loss and far less energy consumption.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924013607001756</span>
                        <p>These composites play an important role in simplifying the manufacturability and this helps in significantly reducing the stator cost of an AFM, which is one of the most complex and difficult components to manufacture.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Reducing Bill of Material with SMCs</h2>
                        <p>In addition to making AFM manufacturing easier, SMCs can also reduce the bill of material for an AFM. This is because SMCs can be made with a high magnetic flux density, which allows for a thinner stator core. This reduces the amount of material required and can result in a lower overall cost for the motor.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Comparing SMCs with Traditional Axial Flux Motors Using Laminations</h2>
                        <p>Traditional axial flux motors typically use laminations in their design, which can come with a variety of inherent weaknesses. One of the main issues is that the stator is difficult to manufacture and automate due to the complex shape of the laminations. This can result in a higher manufacturing cost and longer lead times. Additionally, laminations are prone to eddy current losses, which can reduce the efficiency of the motor.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Alleviating These Issues with SMCs</h2>
                        <p>SMCs can alleviate all these issues and unlock the hidden assets of AFMs by providing a more manufacturable and cost-effective solution. With the help of these composites, the stator can be easily formed into intricate shapes and smooth corners without wasting the material in the stage of moulding and sintering process, thus, reducing the manufacturing cost and lead time.</p>
